# Practicum 2: Playtesting - Overfruit

## Description

The game we created is a variant of the well-known mobile game Fruit Ninja. In here, you will have fruits appearing in waves all over the screen and your objective is to cut them. 
Each fruit will give you a certain amount of points when cutting them down. But be careful, do not touch a bomb. If you do so, the game will take off a few points, but most importantly, you will lose a life. 
If you don’t manage to cut a fruit in time and said fruit falls down, you will also lose a life. You start with a total of 3 lifes. The difficulty of the game will increase as time goes on until you manage to beat the game. 
Also, the game offers the playtester two game modes. One consists of swiping the mouse (while having the left click down) to cut the fruits and the other one consists in tapping the fruits with the cursor to destroy them.

## Playtesting method

Each playtester must play each game mode for 5 minutes. If a playtester reaches the time limit during the match, he will be allowed to finish that game.

##	Controls for each game mode

- Game mode 1: (Mouse) Swipe with the left click held down to cut fruits.

- Game mode 2: (Mouse) Single tap on the fruits to destroy them.
